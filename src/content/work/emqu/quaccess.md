QUaccess is an upgraded version of the original SISTGO project â€” essentially a "SISTGO 2". It's a robust platform that streamlines human resource management by centralizing tasks like employee account creation, attendance tracking, substitution approvals, and custom questionnaire design, all in one easy-to-use system.
