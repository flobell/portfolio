SISTGO is an integrated security management system designed to streamline operations across various security and administrative tasks. It includes an Attendance Control application with five different methods to register attendance, helping to track schedules and generate detailed reports for both security and administrative staff. The Access Control feature monitors the entry and exit of personnel, vehicles, and equipment at different locations, using security badges and facial recognition for enhanced safety. The Supervisor App enables the management of supervisory staff by assigning customized patrols and questionnaires to be completed at each site. The Patrol App is ideal for security guard monitoring, allowing for control point check-ins and reporting during their rounds. With the Logbook App, clients can create and schedule questions in various formats—text, images, or voice—which are then sent to the security staff for completion. The system also includes Third-Party Attendance, offering clients the ability to manage and control the access of external personnel. All these features are managed through a centralized Web Portal, which provides oversight of clients, locations, and security personnel, along with real-time alarm alerts for fast response and decision-making.
